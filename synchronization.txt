Chapter: Parallelism and Concurrency
------------------------------------

We distinguish between parallelism and concurrency.  

We use the term *_parallel_* to refer to an algorithm or application
that performs multiple computations at the same time for the purposes
of improving the completion or run time of the algorithm or
application.  The input-output behavior or the extrinsic semantics of
a parallel computation can be defined purely sequentially, even though
the computation itself executes in parallel.

We use the term *_concurrent_* to refer to a computation that involves
independent agents, which can be implemented with processes or
threads, that communicate and coordinate to accomplish the intended
result. The input-output behavior or the extrinsic semantics of a
concurrent application cannot be defined purely sequentially; we must
consider the interaction between  different threads.


In other words, parallelism is a property of the platform (software
and/or hardware) on which the computation takes place, whereas
concurrency is a property of the application.  A concurrent program
can be executed serially or in parallel. 

For example, the sorting algorithms that we covered earlier are
parallel but they are not concurrent, because the algorithms do not
involve communication between different, independent agents; an
operating system on the other hand is a concurrent application, where
many processes (agents) may run at the same time and communicate to
accomplish a task.  For example, when you request these notes to be
downloaded to your laptop, the kernel, the file system, and your
browser communicate to accomplish the task.  Web browsers are
typically written as concurrent applications because they may include
multiple processes to communicate with the operating system, the
network, and the user, all of which coordinate as needed.

Parallelism and concurrency are orthogonal dimensions in the space of
all applications.  Some applications are concurrent, some are not.
Many concurrent applications can benefit from parallelism.  For
example, a browser, which is a concurrent application itself as it may
use a parallel algorithm to perform certain tasks.  On the other hand,
there is often no need to add concurrency to a parallel application,
because this unnecessarily complicates software.  It can, however,
lead to improvements in efficiency.

The following quote from Dijkstra suggest pursuing the approach of
making parallelism just a matter of execution (not one of semantics),
which is the goal of the much of the work on the development of 
programming languages for parallel programs today.

/////
Note that Dijkstra uses the term "concurrency" to refer to
simultaneous execution of instructions by the machine. 
/////

[quote, Edsger W. Dijkstra, Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective (EWD 508)]
From the past terms such as "sequential programming" and "parallel
programming" are still with us, and we should try to get rid of them,
for they are a great source of confusion.  They date from the period
that it was the purpose of our programs to instruct our machines, now
it is the purpose of the machines to execute our programs.  Whether
the machine does so sequentially, one thing at a time, or with
considerable amount of concurrency, is a matter of implementation, and
should _not_ be regarded as a property of the programming language.  



Race conditions and concurrency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though concurrent behavior is not necessary in parallel
computing, it can arise as a result of shared state.  When shared
variables are used for communication, for example by reading and
writing the variable, between threads, we may have to treat the
computation as a concurrent program to understand its behavior.

Consider a simple example function, which increments a counter in
parallel for a specified number of times latexmath:[$n$].  The code
for such a function is shown below.  The function `concurrent_counter`
takes a number `n` and uses a parallel-for loop to increment the
variable `counter`.  When called with a large `n`, this function will
create many threads that increment `counter` in parallel.

[source,{cpp}]
--------------
loop_controller_type concurrent_counter_contr ("parallel for");

void concurrent_counter(long n) {
  long counter = 0;

  auto incr = [&] () {
    counter = counter + 1;
  };
    
  par::parallel_for(concurrent_counter_contr, 0l, n, [&] (long i) {
      incr(); 
  });

  std::cout << "Concurrent-counter: " << "n = " << n << " result = " << counter << std::endl;
}
--------------

Since it is implemented by using our parallelism constructs, we may
feel that the function `concurrent_counter` is parallel.  To define
its behavior, we may thus conclude that we can ignore the parallelism
constructs, because such constructs only impact the way that the
function is executed but not its semantics.  So we may describe the
semantics (input-output behavior) of `concurrent_counter` as taking a
value `n`, incrementing it `n` times, and since `counter` starts out
at `0`, printing the value `n` in the end.  But this is hardly the
case, as shown below by several runs of the function.


---------------

$ make example.opt
...

// problem size = 1K, counter = 1K
$ ./example.opt -example concurrent_counter -n 1000 -proc 16
Concurrent-counter:n = 1000 result = 1000
exectime 0.000
total_idle_time 0.000
utilization 0.9790

// problem size = 100M, counter < 10M.
$ ./example.opt -example concurrent_counter -n 100000000 -proc 16
Concurrent-counter:n = 100000000 result = 6552587
exectime 0.016
total_idle_time 0.046
utilization 0.8236

// problem size = 100M, counter < 10M.
$ ./example.opt -example concurrent_counter -n 100000000 -proc 24
Concurrent-counter:n = 100000000 result = 5711624
exectime 0.015
total_idle_time 0.046
utilization 0.8743

// problem size = 100M, counter ~ 10M.
$ ./example.opt -example concurrent_counter -n 100000000 -proc 24
Concurrent-counter:n = 100000000 result = 10785626
exectime 0.020
total_idle_time 0.128
utilization 0.7338

---------------

What has gone wrong is that the function `concurrent_counter` is in
fact concurrent--not parallel--because the counter is a variable that
is shared by many parallel threads, each of which read the value and
update it by using multiple instructions. In fact, as we will see, the
parallel updates to the counter lead to a race condition.  More
generally, a program written with our parallelism constructs is only
truly parallel if and only if parallel computations are
*_disentangled_*, i.e., they don't interact by reading and writing
memory, as for example in purely functional programs.  Note that this
restriction holds only for parts of the computation that execute in
parallel, those that are not parallel can read and write from memory.

To understand more specifically what goes wrong, we need to rewrite
our example to reflect the code, shown below, as executed by our
machines.  The only difference from the previous example is the `incr`
function, which now uses separate operations to read the counter, to
calculate the next value, and to write into it.  The point is that the
computation of reading-a-value-and-updating-it is not an *_atomic_*
operation that executes in one step but a composite operation that
takes place in three steps:

. read `counter` into local, non-shared variable `current`,
. increment `current`, and
. write the updated value of `current` into shared variable `counter`.

[source,{cpp}]
--------------
loop_controller_type concurrent_counter_contr ("parallel for");

void concurrent_counter(long n) {
  long counter = 0;

  auto incr = [&] () {
    long current = counter;
    current = current + 1;
    counter = current;
  };
    
  par::parallel_for(concurrent_counter_contr, 0l, n, [&] (long i) {
      incr(); 
  });

  std::cout << "Concurrent-counter: " << "n = " << n << " result = " << counter << std::endl;
}

--------------
				   
Since in a parallel execution, multiple threads can execute the
function `incr` in parallel, the shared variable `counter` may not be
updated as expected.  To see this, consider just two parallel
executions of `incr` that both start out the current value of
`counter` let`s say `i`, locally calculate `i+1`, and write it back.
The resulting value of `counter` is thus `i+1` even though `incr` has
been applied twice. This is the reason for missed increments
illustrated by the runs above.



Eliminating race conditions by synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As discussed in an earlier <<ch::race-conditions, chapter>>, we can
use synchronization operations provided by modern hardware to
eliminate race codnitions.  In particular, we can use compare-and-swap
in our example.  Since compare-and-swap allows us to update
the value stored at a location atomically, we can use it to implement
our increment function as shown below.  To this end, we declare
`counter` as a atomic long type; the syntax `std::atomic<long>`
declares an atomic `long`. In the function `incr`, we load the value
of the counter into a local variable `current` and use
compare-and-swap to replace the value of the `counter` with
`current+1` by calling `compare_exchange_strong`, which implements the
compare-and-swap operation.  Since compare-and-swap can fail, because
of another thread succeeding to update at the same time, function
`incr` tries this update cycle until the operation succeeds.  

[source,{cpp}]
--------------
loop_controller_type concurrent_counter_atomic_contr ("parallel for");

void concurrent_counter_atomic(long n) {
  std::atomic<long> counter;
  counter.store(0);

  auto incr = [&] () {
    while (true) { 
      long current = counter.load();
      if (counter.compare_exchange_strong (current,current+1)) {
        break;
      }
    }
  };

  par::parallel_for(concurrent_counter_atomic_contr, 0l, n, [&] (long i) {
      incr(); 
  });

  std::cout << "Concurrent-counter-atomic: " << "n = " << n << " result = " << counter << std::endl;
}
--------------

Here are some example runs of this code with varying number of
processors.  Note that the counter is always updated correctly, but
the execution takes significantly longer time (approximately 10 times
slower, accounting for the loss of parallelism due to the atomic
operation) than the incorrect implementation with the race condition.
This shows how expensive synchronization operations can be.
Intuitively, synchronization operations are expensive, because they
can require atomic access to memory and because they disable certain
compiler optimizations.  The reality is significantly more complex,
because modern multicore computers have memory models that are only
weakly consistent and because they rely on several levels of caches,
which are nevertheless kept consistent by using "cache coherency
protocols".
