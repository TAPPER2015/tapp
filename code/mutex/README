Several mutual exclusion examples.

** COMPILING
Use C++11

g++ -std=c++11  nb-stack-int.h



** STACKS
Generic versions are not in working order.  The rest should be correct.

FILES
The main files are
stack-int.h  (serial)
nb-stack-int-aba.h (nonblocking, with the aba problem)
nb-stack-int.h (nonblocking)

and 
main-int.cpp
stack-driver.cpp


** TEACH

*** Big Lock example for the screen 
g++ -std=c++11  biglock-driver.cpp 


** stack-driver
g++ -std=c++11  stack-driver.cpp
