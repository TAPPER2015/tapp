Preface
-------

The goal of these notes is to introduce the reader to the following.

. Parallel computing in imperative programming languages and
Clatexmath:[++] in particular, and 
. Real-world performance and efficiency concerns in writing parallel
software and techniques for dealing with them.

For parallel programming in Clatexmath:[++], we use a library, called
*PASL*, that we have been developing over the past 5 years.  The
implementation of the library uses advanced scheduling techniques to
run parallel programs efficiently on modern multicores and provides a
range of utilities for understanding the behavior of parallel
programs.

PASL stands for Parallel Algorithm Scheduling Library. It also sounds
a bit like the French phrase "pas seul" (pronounced "pa-sole"),
meaning "not alone".

We expect that the instructions in this book and PASL to allow the
reader to write performant parallel programs at a relatively high
level (essentially at the same level of C++ code) without having to
worry too much about lower level details such as machine specific
optimizations, which might otherwise be necessary.

All code that associated with this book can be found at the Github
repository linked by the following URL:

This code-base includes the examples presented in the book,  see file
`minicourse/examples.hpp`.

This book does not focus on the design and analysis of parallel
algorithms.  The interested reader can find more details this topic in
