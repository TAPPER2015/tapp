o graphs: present the graph library and the operations possible.
o graphs: point out the compressed adjacency list representation.
o sorting: observed work efficiency factor terminology.
o parallel arrays: show destructors/deallocation, and the move operator.



---------------

After the lectures:

o Work efficiency: rewrite that section to use only array increment as
an example.  Fib is confusing.

o Since Fib is a bogus example, it would be nice to eliminate it (as
much as possible, starting with section 3.)


---------


o Do we plan to finish "work efficiency" at the end of Day 1?  If so,
then we probably definitely need to do the first item above.

o Move the homework 1 exercise to the end of Day 1.

o Should "parallel arrays and data parallelism" be under the same title?


o use map_incr as example for granularity control (not fib)
